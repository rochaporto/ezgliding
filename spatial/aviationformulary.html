<h4><a href=3D"http://williams.best.vwh.net/Intro" name=3D"Intro"></a>Intro=
duction</h4>

<p>This introduction is written for pilots (and others) who are
interested in great circle navigation and would like to know how
to compute courses, headings and other quantities of interest.
These formulae can be programmed into your calculator or
spreadsheet. I'll attempt to include enough information that
those familiar with plane trigonometry can derive additional
results if required. </p>

<p>It is a well known that the shortest distance between two
points is a straight line. However anyone attempting to fly from
Los Angeles to New York on the straight line connecting them
would have to dig a very substantial tunnel first. The shortest
distance, <em>following the earth's surface </em>lies vertically
above the aforementioned straight line route. This route can be
constructed by slicing the earth in half with an imaginary plane
through LAX and JFK. This plane cuts the (assumed spherical)
earth in a circular arc connecting the two points, called a <em>great
</em>circle. Only planes through the center of the earth give
rise to great circles. Any plane will cut a sphere in a circle,
but the resulting little circles are not the shortest distance
between the points they connect. A little thought will show that
lines of longitude (meridians) are great circles, but lines of
latitude, with the exception of the equator, are not. </p>

<p>I will assume the reader is familiar with latitude and
longitude as a means of designating locations on the earth's
surface. For the convenience of North Americans I will take North
latitudes and West longitudes as positive and South and East
negative. The longitude is the opposite of the usual mathematical
convention. True course is defined as usual, as the angle between
the course line and the local meridian measured clockwise. </p>

<p>The first important fact to realise is that in general a great
circle route has a true course that varies from point to point.
For instance the great circle route between two points of equal
(non-zero) latitude does not follow the line of latitude in an
E-W direction, but arcs towards the pole. It <em>is</em> possible
to fly between two points using an unvarying true course, but in
general the resulting route differs from the great circle route
and is called a <em>rhumb </em>line. Unlike a great circle which
encircles the earth in a closed curve, a pilot flying a rhumb line
 would spiral poleward. </p>

<p>Natural questions are to seek the great circle distance
between two specified points and true course at points along the
route. The required spherical trigonometric formulae are greatly
simplified if angles and distances are measured in the
appropriate natural units, which are both radians! A radian, by
definition, is the angle subtended by a circular arc of unit
length and unit radius. Since the length of a complete circular
arc of unit radius is 2*pi, the conversion is 360 degrees equals
2*pi radians, or:</p>

<pre>      angle_radians=3D(pi/180)*angle_degrees
      angle_degrees=3D(180/pi)*angle_radians </pre>

<p>Great circle distance can be likewise be expressed in radians
by defining the distance to be the angle subtended by the arc at
the center of the earth. Since by definition, one nautical mile
subtends one minute (=3D1/60 degree) of arc, we have:</p>

<pre>      distance_radians=3D(pi/(180*60))*distance_nm
      distance_nm=3D((180*60)/pi)*distance_radians </pre>

<p>In all subsequent formulae all distances and angles, such as
latitudes, longitudes and true courses will be assumed to be
given in radians, greatly simplifying them, and in applications
the above formulae and their inverses are necessary to convert
back and forth between natural and practical units. Examples of
this process are given later. </p>

<p> Note: the nautical mile is currently defined to be 1852 meters -=20
which to be
consistent with its historical definition implies the earth's radius to
be 1.852 * (180*60/pi) =3D 6366.71 km, which indeed lies between the curren=
tly=20
accepted ( WGS84) equatorial and polar radii of 6378.137 and 6356.752 km,=
=20
respectively. Other choices of the earth's radius in this range are consist=
ent
with the spherical approximation and may for some specialized purposes=20
be preferred.</p>  =20
<p>   For instance, the former FAI standard for aviation records used the
"FAI sphere" with radius 6371.0 km.</p>
<p>  To use a different spherical radius, use </p>
<pre>      distance_km =3D radius_km * distance_radians=20
      distance_radians =3D distance_km/radius_km
</pre>
to convert
between angular and distance units.
<p></p>
<p> A sample implementation of many of these formulae in the
form of an Excel spreadsheet can be found
<a href=3D"http://williams.best.vwh.net/ftp/avsig/avform.xls">here</a>. The=
 formulae are in
VBA macros, for readability, so you will need to enable macros
to have them work. If you are unable to open the spreadsheet
with macros disabled (to check for viruses) etc, then you
may need to patch your Excel. Try

for Excel 97 SR-2.

<h4>Some great circle formulae:

<h5><a href=3D"http://williams.best.vwh.net/Dist" name=3D"Dist"></a>Distanc=

<p>The great circle distance d between two points with
coordinates {lat1,lon1} and {lat2,lon2} is given by: </p>

<pre>d=3Dacos(sin(lat1)*sin(lat2)+cos(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(lon1-lon2))</pre>

<p>A mathematically equivalent formula, which is less subject to
rounding error for short distances is: </p>

<pre>d=3D2*asin(sqrt((sin((lat1-lat2)/2))^2 +=20
                 cos(lat1)*cos(lat2)*(sin((lon1-lon2)/2))^2))</pre>
<hr>
<h5><a href=3D"http://williams.best.vwh.net/Crs" name=3D"Crs"></a>Course be=
tween points </h5>

<p>We obtain the initial course, tc1, (at point 1) from point 1 to point 2
by the following. The formula fails if the initial point is a pole. We can
special case this with:
  </p>
<pre>IF (cos(lat1) &lt; EPS)   // EPS a small number ~ machine precision
  IF (lat1 &gt; 0)
     tc1=3D pi        //  starting from N pole
  ELSE
     tc1=3D 2*pi         //  starting from S pole
  ENDIF
ENDIF
</pre>

<p> For starting points other than the poles:
</p>

<pre>IF sin(lon2-lon1)&lt;0      =20
   tc1=3Dacos((sin(lat2)-sin(lat1)*cos(d))/(sin(d)*cos(lat1)))   =20
ELSE      =20
   tc1=3D2*pi-acos((sin(lat2)-sin(lat1)*cos(d))/(sin(d)*cos(lat1)))   =20
ENDIF </pre>

<p>An alternative formula, not requiring the pre-computation of
d, the distance between the points, is: </p>

<pre>   tc1=3Dmod(atan2(sin(lon1-lon2)*cos(lat2),
           cos(lat1)*sin(lat2)-sin(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(lon1-lon2)), 2*pi)</=

&lt;pi/2, i.e those that extend around less than one quarter of
the circumference of the earth in longitude. A completely
general, but more complicated algorithm is necessary if greater
distances are allowed: </p>

<h5>Crossing parallels: </h5>

<p>Any given great circle (excepting one over the poles) crosses each
meridian once and only once. However, any given great circle (except
the equator) has a maximum latitude reached at its apex. It crosses
lower latitudes twice and higher latitudes never. Thus the algorithm
for finding the longitudes at which a given great circle crosses a
given parallel is a little more complex. </p>

</a>Intermediate points on a great circle</h5>
<p>

In previous sections we have found intermediate points on a great
circle given either the crossing latitude or longitude. Here we find
points (lat,lon) a given fraction of the distance (d) between
them. Suppose the starting point is (lat1,lon1) and the final point
(lat2,lon2) and we want the point a fraction f along the great circle
route. f=3D0 is point 1. f=3D1 is point 2.  The two points cannot be
antipodal ( i.e. lat1+lat2=3D0 and abs(lon1-lon2)=3Dpi) because then the
route is undefined.  The intermediate latitude and longitude is then given =
by:

</p>

        B=3Dsin(f*d)/sin(d)

<p>Suppose you are proceeding on a great circle route from A to B
(course =3Dcrs_AB) and end up at D, perhaps off course. (We presume that
A is ot a pole!) You can calculate the course from A to D (crs_AD) and
the distance from A to D (dist_AD) using the formulae above. In terms
of these the cross track error, XTD, (distance off course) is given by
</p>

/a>Implementation
notes:<a href=3D"http://williams.best.vwh.net/Math" name=3D"Math"></a></h4>

<h5>Notes on mathematical functions</h5>

<p>Note: ^ denotes the exponentiation operator, sqrt is the
square root function, acos the arc-cosine (or inverse cosine)
function and asin is the arc-sine function. If asin or acos are
unavailable they can be implemented using the atan2 function: </p>

<pre>acos(x)=3Datan2(sqrt(1-x^2),x)
  acos returns a value in the range 0 &lt;=3D acos &lt;=3D pi
asin(x)=3Datan2(x,sqrt(1-x^2))}
  asin returns a value in the range -pi/2 &lt;=3D asin &lt;=3D pi/2</pre>

<p>Note: Here atan2 has the conventional (C) ordering of
arguments, namely atan2(y,x). This is not universal, Excel for
instance uses atan2(x,y), but it has asin and acos anyway. Be
warned. It returns a value in the range -pi &lt; atan2 &lt;=3D pi. </p>



<p>Further note: if your calculator/programming language is so
impoverished that only atan is available then use: </p>

<pre>   asin(x)=3D2*atan(x/(1+sqrt(1-x*x)))  =20
   acos(x)=3D2*atan(sqrt((1-x)/(1+x)))       x&gt;=3D0
          =3Dpi - 2*atan(sqrt((1+x)/(1-x)))  x&lt;0

   atan2(y,x)=3Datan(y/x)       x&gt;0
   atan2(y,x)=3Datan(y/x)+pi    x&lt;0, y&gt;=3D0
   atan2(y,x)=3Dpi/2            x=3D0, y&gt;0
   atan2(y,x)=3Datan(y/x)-pi    x&lt;0, y&lt;0
   atan2(y,x)=3D-pi/2           x=3D0, y&lt;0
   atan2(0,0) is undefined and should give an error.
</pre>

<p>Another potential implementation problem is that the arguments
of asin and/or acos may, because of rounding error, exceed one in
magnitude. With perfect arithmetic this can't happen. You may
need to use "safe" versions of asin and acos on the
lines of: </p>

<pre>  asin_safe(x)=3Dasin(max(-1,min(x,1)))
  acos_safe(x)=3Dacos(max(-1,min(x,1)))</pre>

<p>Note on the mod function. This appears to be implemented
differently in different languages, with differing conventions on whether t=
he sign of the result
 follows the sign of the divisor or the dividend. (We want the sign to=20
<a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">follow the diviso=
r or be Euclidean.</a> C's fmod and Java's % do not work.)
In this document, Mod(y,x) is the remainder on
dividing y by x and always lies in the range 0 &lt;=3Dmod &lt;x.
For instance: mod(2.3,2.)=3D0.3 and mod(-2.3,2.)=3D1.7
</p>
<p>

  If you have a floor function (int in Excel), that returns=20
floor(x)=3D "largest integer less than or equal to x"
e.g. floor(-2.3)=3D-3 and floor(2.3) =3D2
</p>
<pre>        mod(y,x) =3D y - x*floor(y/x)
</pre>
The following should work in the absence of a floor function-
regardless of whether "int" truncates or rounds downward: <p></p>

<pre>=20
    mod=3Dy - x * int(y/x)
    if ( mod &lt; 0) mod =3D mod + x
</pre>

<h5><a href=3D"http://williams.best.vwh.net/Sign" name=3D"Sign"></a>Sign Co=
nvention </h5>

<p>As stated in the introduction, North latitudes and <em>West </em>longitu=
des
are treated as positive, and South latitudes and East longitudes
negative. It's easier to go with the flow, but if you prefer
another convention you can change the signs in the formulae. </p>

   tan((A-B)/2)=3Dcot(C/2)*sin((a-b)/2)/sin((a+b)/2)
   tan((A+B)/2)=3Dcot(C/2)*cos((a-b)/2)/cos((a+b)/2)

<p>In any of these formulae, A, B and C can be interchanged, provided a,
b and c change with them.
  ie a-&gt;b, b-&gt;c, c-&gt;a, A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, C-&gt;A.
 In addition, the formulae hold if pi-a is written for A, pi-b for B and pi=

<p>Rhumb lines or loxodromes are tracks of constant true course.
With the exception of meridians and the equator, they are not the
same as great circles. They are not very useful approaching
either pole, where they become tightly wound spirals. The
formulae below fail if any point actually <em>is</em> a pole. </p>
<p> East-West rhumb lines are special. They follow the latitude parallels
and form a closed curve. Other rhumb lines extend from pole-to-pole, encirc=
ling
each pole an infinite number of times. Despite this, they have a finite len=
gth
given by pi/abs(cos(tc)) (in our angular units, multiply by the radius of
the earth to get it in distance units).

</p><p>When two points (lat1,lon1), (lat2,lon2) are connected by a
rhumb line with true course tc : </p>

<p>(logs are "natural" logarithms to the base e.) </p>

<p>The true course between the points is given by: </p>

The TAS and windspeed are then given by sqrt(vms*bp) and sqrt(vms*bm)

<p>The relative humidity, f (as a fraction) is related to the
temperature, T and dewpoint Td by:</p>

<pre>       f=3D exp(17.27(Td/(Td+237.3)-T/(T+237.3)))

and to the frostpoint temperature Tf by:

       f=3D exp(21.87(Tf/(Tf+265.5)-T/(T+265.5)))</pre>

<p>Temperatures are in Celsius. Multiply f by 100 if you want a
percentage. The above are based on an empirical fit to the
saturation vapor pressure of water due to O. Tetens in <i>Zeitschrift
fur Geophysik, Vol VI</i> (1930), quoted in <i>"Principles
of Meteorological Analysis"</i> by W. J. Saucier (Dover NY

<p>Tables of Relative Humidity and Dewpoint vs Temperature and
Wet Bulb Temperature can be found in "Introduction to
Meteorology" by Franklyn Cole (Wiley NY 1975).</p>

<p>Inverting this to find dewpoint in terms of temp and RH: </p>

<pre> Dewpoint   Td=3D237.3/(1/(ln(f)/17.27+T/(T+237.3))-1)
 Frostpoint Tf=3D265.5/(1/(ln(f)/21.87+T/(T+265.5))-1)</pre>

<p>Given the wet bulb temperature Tw (=B0C), the dry bulb
temperature T (=B0C), and the pressure, p in mbar one gets the
(approximate) relative humidity and dewpoint by the following: </p>

<pre> ed=3D 6.11*exp(17.27*T/(T+237.3))       /* SVP at dry-bulb temp
 ew=3D 6.11*exp(17.27*Tw/(Tw+237.3))       /* SVP at wet-bulb temp
 wd=3D0.62197*ed/(p-ed)                /* saturation mixing ratio at T
 ww=3D0.62197*ew/(p-ew)                /* saturation mixing ratio at Tw
 w=3D(2500.0*ww-1.0046*(T-Tw))/(2500.0+1.81*(T-Tw)) /* mixing ratio
 f=3D w/wd                             /* relative humidity as a fraction
 e=3D p*w/(0.62197+w)                  /* vapor pressure (mb)
 Td=3D(237.3*log10(e)-186.527)/(8.286-log10(e)) /* the dewpoint (C)</pre>

<p>This uses the Tetens fit for the saturated vapor pressure and
treat water vapor as an ideal gas, both of which are pretty good
approximations. If you want better refer to the Smithsonian
Meteorological Tables (<i> Smithsonian Institute 1963 </i>) </p>

<p>A related formula gives the increase in effective density
altitude due to humidity. It only addresses the reduction of air
density, and not the effect on engine power output:</p>

<pre>Increase(ft)=3D0.267*RH*(T+273)*exp(17.3*T/(T+237))*(1-0.00000688*H)^(=
-5.26) </pre>

<p>RH (f above) is the relative humidity expressed as a fraction,
T is the temperature in Celsius and H is the pressure altitude in
feet.</p>

<p>Examples are:</p>

<pre> SL/30C/100% -&gt; 565' increase in DA
 10000/5C/80% -&gt; 124' increase in DA
 5000/40C/80% -&gt; 977' increase in DA. </pre>

<p>In terms of the dewpoint, Td the formula is:</p>

<pre>  Increase(ft)=3D0.267*(T+273)*exp(17.3*Td/(Td+237))*(1-0.00000688*H)^=
(-5.26)</pre>

<h4>Bellamy's formula. </h4>

<p>Bellamy's formula for the wind drift and (single) wind
correction angle is as follows:</p>

<pre>   Drift (nm) =3D 21500*(p2-p1)/(sin(latitude)*TAS)  (p2-p1 in inches)
              =3D 635  *(p2-p1)/(sin(latitude)*TAS)  (p2-p1 in mB)

   Wind Correction Angle=3D 1230000*(p2-p1)/(sin(latitude)*TAS*Dist)  (inch=
es)
                        =3D 36300*  (p2-p1)/(sin(latitude)*TAS*Dist)   (mB)=
 </pre>

<p><code>p2-p1 </code>is the difference between the destination
and departure pressures. <code>latitude </code>is the average
latitude on the route. <code>TAS</code> is the true airspeed in
knots. <code>Dist</code> is the distance in nm. </p>

<p>If the destination pressure is higher, the drift is to the
left, and the required WCA is to the right (and vice-versa).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>SFO -&gt; LAX 300nm at 100 knots, latitude 36 degrees. Suppose
the LAX altimeter setting is 0.2" higher (better the actual
pressure difference at cruise altitude if you can get it).</p>

<pre>    Drift =3D 21500*0.2/(sin(36)*100)=3D 73nm left
    WCA=3D1230000*0.2/(sin(36)*100*300)=3D 14 degrees right</pre>

</p>
<pre>1.27</pre>
<p>
4.2558797 =3D Mg/RT'-1 not Mg/RT_0-1 , and
</p><p>
38.967854 =3D sqrt(gamma R/M) (in knots/Kelvin^0.5) (numerical formulae OK)
</p><p>
Added reference to intersections of two great circles.
</p>
<pre>1.26</pre>
<p>
5.2558797 =3D Mg/RT' not Mg/RT_0 (numerical formulae OK)
</p>
<pre>1.25</pre>
<p>
Head and cross-wind components.
</p>
<pre>1.24</pre>
<p>
 Corrected some last digit rounding errors in the rhumb line examples. Adde=
d
a reference to the latest (1983) National Bureau of Standards fits
to the vapor pressure of water over water and ice.
(Thank you Oscar Van Vlijmen!)
</p>
<pre>1.23</pre>
<p>
 Additions to spherical triangle section
</p>
<pre>1.22</pre>
<p>
 Course between points formula failed if the initial point was exactly a po=
le.
This has to be special-cased.
</p>
<pre>1.21</pre>
<p>
  Added references to sunrise/sunset
</p>
<p>
  Added Mach -&gt; IAS formulae
</p>
<pre>1.20</pre>
<p>
  Third numerical example of the effect of humidity on density
altitude corrected.
</p>
<p>
  Added standard rate turn bank angle rule-of-thumb.
</p>

<pre>1.19</pre>
<p>
Another bug in the intersection section... The test for input data where
"no intersection exists", or more precisely, when it's ambiguous which of t=
he
two
great circle intersections is desired, was misplaced. With valid data, no
problem...
</p>
<p>
The Clarke66/NAD27 inverse flattening was incorrect in my reference book.
Corrected.
Thanks to Larry Lewis.
</p>

<pre>1.18</pre>
  Corrected equation for dst12 in intersection section. (Should have been
the distance formula in the first section!) The numerical example
used the correct formula.

<pre>1.17</pre>

<p>(1/26/98) Changed formula constants to use 1976 US/ICAO Standard
Atmosphere instead of 1962 US Standard. Made unit conversions more
accurate.=20
(by Doug Haluza)
</p>

<pre>1.16</pre>

<p>(10/26/97) Corrected conversion to hh:mm:ss
seconds=3D60*(60*(angle_degrees-degrees)-minutes)) </p>

<pre>1.15 </pre>

<p>(9/11/97) Added European variation fit </p>

<pre>1.14</pre>

<p>(9/2/97) Added warnings about arguments of asin and acos being
out of range from rounding error. </p>

<pre>1.13</pre>

<p>(8/31/97) The rhumb line section was rewritten. Erroneously
corrected one formula, then changed it back! Added a numerical
example for the calculation of the endpoint of a rhumb line.
Added some more spherical triangle formulae. </p>

<pre>1.12</pre>

<p>Somehow I dropped a line in the the 1.08 atan2 fix. Sigh!
Added turn radius, pivotal altitude formulae. </p>

<pre>1.11</pre>

<p>Made "Lat/lon given radial and distance" handle the
pole endpoint case more elegantly. </p>

<pre>1.10</pre>

<p>Add "find CRS, GS" to wind triangle section </p>

<pre>1.09</pre>

<p>Added geodetic/geocentric coordinate conversion </p>

<pre>1.08</pre>

<p>Added an alternative method for calculation of course between
two points, not requiring pre-computation of the distance between
them. </p>

<p>Changed the definition of atan2 to the ANSI standard one where
it is defined to have a range of -pi &lt; atan2 &lt;=3D pi, rather
than 0 &lt;=3D atan2 &lt; 2pi. This was a bug only if had you used
the previous version to define asin in terms of atan via atan2.
No one reported it though... </p>

<p>Corrected some damaged formulae in the intersection section of
the html version. </p>

<pre>1.07 (4/1/97) </pre>

<p>Add additional spherical triangle formulae. Correct the
condition (dlon&lt;pi/2) for the validity of the short range
formula in the "lat/lon given radial and distance"
section. </p>

<pre>1.06 (3/3/97)</pre>

<p>Correct typo in html version of HDG/GS formula. (minus sign)
Definitions of a and b swapped in Tejen's fit to saturation vapor
pressure. </p>

<pre>1.05 (12/17/96) </pre>

<p>Correct test for pole in formula for computing lat/long of a
point a given radial and distance: lat=3D0 =3D&gt; cos(lat)=3D0 </p>

<pre>1.04 (11/11/95) </pre>

<p>Add formula for computing lat/long of a point a given radial
and distance valid when the distance can exceed one quarter of
the earth's circumference. </p>

<p>Note that atan2(0,0) should return an error. </p>

<p>Add rhumb line formulae and example. </p>

<p>Change intersection calculation to only provide result when
intersection of radials exists. </p>
